# Learn Network Manager

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [network-manager](https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the `network-manager` package on Launchpad. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors and should be used under the same license. See [their license on Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/network-manager/tree/COPYING) or [the license on freedesktop.org](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/blob/main/COPYING).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.
